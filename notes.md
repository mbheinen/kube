[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)

k8s - "kates"
`kubectl` - "koob e" or "koob" or "cube" plus "cuttle" or "C T L" or "control". Main command line interface for working with Kubernetes clusters.

## Full VMs on Kubernetes
Existing Virtual Machine-based workloads that cannot be easily containerized

## Helm
Can think of it as package managment for Kubernetes or as reference releases of Kubernetes configurations.
